<h2 style='color:aliceblue'>My opinion</h2>
<h3 style='color:red'>-Marvel</h3>
<p>I am pretty excited about Black Widow. Trailer seems to be good, but i don't like that in cast Tony is going to be immpotant but in the trailer we dosen't saw him at all.</p>
<p>Theme of this movie is exciting so I can't waut to see this movie.</p>
<p>About New Mutants I am not intrested. Iam probably going to watch it, but I it's not going to be something like X-men.</p>

<h3 style='color:blue'>-Star Wars</h3>
<p>This news make me sad becouse I am big fan of Star Wars. But there is maybe going to be Obi Wan movie or series. Star Wars IX was good for me.</p>
<img src="Obi.jpg" alt="Obi" height="300" width="250">

<h3 style='color:coral'>-Fast and furios</h3>
<p>I am not big fan of Fast and furios at all, but i am excited for this. For me Hobbos and Shaw was good so I think that this is going to be better.</p>
<img src="f9.jpg" alt="f9" height="280" width="350">

<h3>Horror</h3>
<p>I can't wait to see this movies becouse I am big fan of Halloween and Saw franchises. But I think that they are not going to be good as Saw and Halloween (first parts). </p>
<img src="Michael.jpg" alt="Michael" height="300" width="200">

<h3 style="color:gray">DC</h3>
<p>For me Birds of Prey are one of biggest disappointments ever. I expect much more from this movie and why they didn't put Joker in movie, I bet then it would be much better.</p>
<p>I was waited so much for this trailer and it finally comes. The first part of Wonder Woman was great so I hope this one is going to be great too. </p>
